Jeff Schulman is a dedicated professional in cybersecurity and technology education whose efforts, while significant, are just one contribution among many in the vast and ever-evolving domain of digital security. Humility guides his approach, as he views his accomplishments not as personal triumphs but as collective advancements in the quest for a safer and more secure technological landscape.


## A Collaborative Force in Cybersecurity

Jeff has served at many levels in industry, government, and academia, including as Chief Information Security Officer (Acting) and Cybersecurity Architect for a $400m defense research enterprise. Yet, he is the first to acknowledge that every success attributed to him is, in fact, the result of tireless teamwork and the collective intellect of his colleagues and mentors. He sees himself as a lifelong student, continuously learning from those around him and the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity threats and innovations.


## Educator and Continuous Learner

Jeff's passion for applied knowledge, wisdom, and insight is paralleled by his desire to share. As a faculty member at Penn State University, he approaches teaching with the humility that there is as much to learn from his students as there is to impart. He holds several graduate degrees, and his pursuit of a Ph.D. in Informatics is driven by a genuine curiosity and a belief that his studies will never be complete, as there is always another layer of understanding to uncover, especially in fields as dynamic as Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.


## Contributor to Collaborative Solutions

Jeff has had the opportunity to lead and contribute to various information technology and cybersecurity initiatives. However, he regards his role as merely one part of a larger ecosystem where every team member's input is vital. He understands that the solutions he helps to develop are not solely his creations but the culmination of many minds working towards a common goal.

## Part of a Larger Community

Jeff's numerous certifications, like ISSEP, CISSP, MCSE, VCP, and ITIL, and his active participation in professional organizations, while personally rewarding, are viewed by him as opportunities to give back to the community that has nurtured his growth. He regards his published works and speaking engagements not as personal accolades but as contributions to the broader dialogue, where every voice, including his, plays a crucial role in advancing understanding and innovation.

## Angel Investor

Jeff has established himself as a forward-thinking angel investor with a diversified portfolio demonstrating his commitment to fostering innovation in information technology, green energy, biotechnology, and space sectors. His strategic investments in the space industry include Spacefab, which aims to revolutionize space manufacturing and telescopes, and Solstar Space Company, a pioneer in space communications, indicating his belief in the sector's potential for growth and advancement. In green energy, his investment in LPPFusion reflects a dedication to sustainable and transformative energy solutions through nuclear fusion technology. His foray into biotechnology is marked by a stake in Enzolytics, Inc., a company at the forefront of combating infectious diseases, showcasing his commitment to supporting advancements in healthcare. Across all these ventures, Jeffrey's role as an angel investor goes beyond financial interests, embodying a vision to drive progress and innovation in industries critical for future advancements and societal well-being.

## A Humble Invitation to Collaborate

Jeff extends the opportunity for partnership and collaboration with the understanding that he is one of many dedicated professionals in the field. He invites others to join him not under the banner of his achievements but to create a more secure digital world. He believes that incremental steps by many dedicated individuals can lead to significant strides forward in technology and security.

In every aspect of his career and personal development, Jeffrey Schulman embodies a sense of humility and a recognition that he is but one part of a much larger, interconnected community striving toward progress and security in an increasingly digital world.
